# VAR-SLAM: Visual Adaptive and Robust SLAM for Dynamic Environments

**VAR-SLAM** introduces a novel feature-based visual SLAM system designed for dynamic environments. It combines a lightweight semantic keypoint filter to deal with known moving objects, with Barron’s adaptive robust loss to handle unknown ones. An adaptive parameter α is estimated online, allowing the system to handle both static and dynamic regions effectively without extensive threshold tuning.
